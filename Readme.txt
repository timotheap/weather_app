this is as ugly as it gets. Next step: rewrite everything including JS (obviously) on my own. 
+ add better weather Icons (but what bothers me is that I have to create an array or whatever 
and I don't find that very efficient, it's just that the built-in weather icons
in the weathermap are ugly.)
